# SpotifyBPM
Personal project, mobile app built using MAUI.
### Features:
+ Authenticating spotify
+ Selecting tempo, key or other details such as liveliness or acousticness
+ Compiling playlists based on the users spotify library (liked songs or saved albums) and the selected parameters
+ Pushing the created playlists to the users spotify library
   
   
## Since the endpoint I planned to use has been deprecated this project is on hold until further notice.
